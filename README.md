## What?

This repo is purely to practice / test git commands. I use it to show
clients who are less familiar with Git workflows how this all works.

## Why?

Because it’s a good idea to have a safe place to make mistakes when
learning to use Git!

## Great, what kind of things should I try to do?

-   Clone the repo

<!-- -->

    git clone https://github.com/cararthompson/sandbox.git

-   Create your own branch
-   Make a change; add, commit, push
-   Create a pull request
-   Experience a merge conflict and learn how to fix it!

I’ll add instructions for all of these in due course!
